# Micro CRM Leads (Project 1)

## Live Deployment
Live: https://p1-leads-gxx3.onrender.com // The public URL where the live application can be accessed (from Render).

## Run Locally

### Setup Instructions
npm install // Installs all project dependencies defined in the package.json file.
npm start // Executes the "start" script defined in package.json (e.g., node server.js).
Open http://localhost:3000/ // Instructs the user where to access the application in their browser.

## Features
- Create and list leads
- Filter by status and search by name or company
- Update status

## Windows and macOS Notes
Open VS Code terminal. The commands are the same on both platforms.

## Reflection (Required for Marking)
I built a simple web-based CRM app where you can add leads, view them in a table, filter them, and update their status. The frontend is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend uses Node.js with Express, storing data in a JSON file instead of a database.
